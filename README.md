# Bus Stops Problemn
C++ Code of the algorithm used as a part of Semester Project of SC 205 course.(Instructor: Prof. Manish K. Gupta) It demonstrates how concepts of Discrete Mathematics like Graph theory can be used to solve the problem of Minimum Path taken by a bus driver  of a school bus so that he can pick up every student covering every stop and return to school.<br>

The Code(C++ Code) which we have attached here performs required stimulation and gives the minimum distance travelled by bus driver to cover all the stops. If you want check your own input You can change the value in the graph.<br>
As of now there is an example values have been put as an testing values.<br>
